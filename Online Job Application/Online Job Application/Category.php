            <h3>For being the Programmer</h3>
            Undergraduate certificates and associate's degrees suffice for some entry-level positions in computer programming, 
            usually only if the applicant has a good amount of applicable work experience. Most employers, however, require programmers to hold at least a bachelor's degree in a field such as computer science, mathematics or information systems. Some jobs even call for a master's degree. Graduate certificates in computer programming are often pursued by individuals to augment a bachelor's degree in business, accounting or finance. Typical courses in a computer programming program cover programming logic, 
            system design and development, programming languages, database management and structured query language (SQL).
